# Recommendation-System
## python Implementation of Recommendation Sysem using scikit-learn library

# About Input files:-

## Dataset used in Project

**Movie Data Set**
4500-5000 movies

**Ratings dataset**
600-650 users
100-150 movies rated per user

# Algorithm used in Project:-

**Cosine Similarity:-**
find similarity or distance bw movies for **Content based filtering** that give **top 50 similar movies** for perticular movie

**Centralized Cosine Similarity**:-
predict rating of the users and find similarity b/w users using **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** that is used in
**Collabrative filtering**

# Summary of the Project
first of all pre-process the data of movie_dataset then calculate similarity bw movie with other movies

**input:-** Movie name


then System will suggest top 50 movies related to input_movie
